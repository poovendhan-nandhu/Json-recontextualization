---

## 5. Activities/Tasks

### Industry-Aligned Activities (2):

1. **Analyze U.S. Market Trends and Target Segments**
   - Review market research reports
   - Analyze consumer behavior and sustainability trends
   - Compare competitors

2. **Formulate Market Entry Recommendation and Success Metrics**
   - Develop strategic recommendation
   - Formulate go/no-go decision
   - Define success metrics

### Activity Alignment Issues:
- ⚠️ Duplicate activity detected ("Formulate VerdeWear's U.S. Market Entry Recommendation" appears twice)
- ⚠️ Some truncated descriptions

---

## 6. Simulation Flow (4 Stages)

| Stage | Name | Activities |
|-------|------|------------|
| 1 | U.S. Market Entry Kick-off | Video briefing, Email with data pack, Confidence poll |
| 2 | Market Entry Analysis & Scoring Framework | Task email, Secondary task, Guidelines, Default |
| 3 | Manager Chat: Market Entry Review | Chat interaction |
| 4 | Reflect | Project reflection, Post-confidence poll |

---

## 7. Resources

### Resource Alignment Issues:
- ⚠️ KLO numbering mismatch (resource references KLO1-KLO5, but only 3 KLOs exist)
- ⚠️ Limited organic T-shirt specific market data
- ⚠️ Competitor analysis stays at generic sustainable apparel level
- ⚠️ Missing explicit KLO-to-resource mapping table
- ⚠️ Go/no-go decision framework incomplete

### Recommendations:
1. Add segmentation approach with example segments
2. Expand KPI framework across full funnel
3. Add go/no-go decision framework with thresholds
4. Make competitor data more specific to organic T-shirts

---

## 8. Workplace Scenario

**Organization:** VerdeWear (digitally native sustainable apparel brand)

**Background:** VerdeWear is exploring expansion into the U.S. market starting with organic cotton T-shirts. Current annual revenue: $8.5M (primarily home market DTC).

**Challenge:** No decision-ready view on U.S. organic T-shirt market entry. Teams using different definitions (organic-only vs. sustainable basics), different channel assumptions.

**Learner Role:** Junior Consultant supporting strategy team

**Reporting Manager:** Sophia Chen, Head of Strategy

## 10. Issues to Fix

### Blockers (Must Fix):
1. **KLO-Question Alignment**: Add questions that directly test KLO1 (market segments) and KLO2 (KPIs)
2. **KLO Numbering**: Fix mismatch between question KLO references and actual KLOs
3. **Resource-KLO Mapping**: Add explicit mapping table from KLOs to resource sections
4. **Competitor Data**: Make more specific to organic T-shirt category

### Warnings (Should Fix):
1. **Duplicate Activities**: Remove or differentiate duplicate "Formulate" activity
2. **Truncated Descriptions**: Complete all activity descriptions
3. **Scope Clarity**: Clarify junior consultant's deliverable boundaries
4. **Source Labeling**: Label illustrative numbers as assumptions vs. sourced data

## Verdict

**Overall Status: ⚠️ USABLE BUT NEEDS REFINEMENT**

The adaptation successfully transformed the HR/recruitment simulation into a retail/sustainable apparel market entry scenario. All learner-facing content is clean of source scenario terms. However, there are alignment gaps between KLOs, questions, and resources that should be addressed for optimal learning experience.

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. Add explicit market segmentation question for KLO1
2. Add KPI development question for KLO2
3. Fix KLO numbering in questions
4. Add KLO-to-resource mapping table
5. De-duplicate activities
