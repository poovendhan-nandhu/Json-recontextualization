Cartedo Simulation Adaptation Framework — Validation Summary Report
Scenario Change: Retail Banking → Airline Operations (Customer Service Training)
Report ID: VAL-2026-01-09-ALOPS-07
Generated on: Jan 9, 2026 (IST)
Audience: PM / Client / QA
Run Definition
One run = the full end-to-end conversion of one simulation into a fully recontextualized “ideal” simulation, including all internal agent passes and the compliance loop.

1) Executive Gate (Go / No-Go)
Overall Status: ✅ APPROVED (Meets Acceptance Bar)
Total runs evaluated: 20
Runs passing all Critical checks: 19 / 20 (95%) ✅ (meets ≥95% requirement)
Runs with only Flagged issues: 6 / 20 (review recommended, not blocking)
Gold output produced: 20 / 20 (golden artifact produced for every run)
Release recommendation: Ship is allowed, but address Flagged Issue Cluster “Persona realism” before client demo.

3) Critical Checks (Blocking) — Aggregated Results
Acceptance rule: A run passes only if all Critical checks pass. Release is acceptable if ≥95% of runs pass all Critical checks.

5) What Failed (Critical) + Why (Human Readable) + Drill-Down
Run 11 — ❌ FAILED (Critical Check C2: Entity Leakage)
Short reason: Found 3 legacy retail-banking entities still present in a passenger disruption handling scenario.
Impact: Breaks scenario authenticity and can confuse learners; violates “no stale references” non-negotiable.
Where it happened: Persona email + one resource snippet
Detected by: Unified Checker (Stage 3) and confirmed by Global Guard (Stage 6)
Pointers
Scorecard: artifacts/run-11/rule_scorecard.json → findings[C2]
Leaked entities list: artifacts/run-11/global_guard_report.json → entity_leakage.matches
Offending shards:
artifacts/run-11/shards/personas/persona_02.json
artifacts/run-11/shards/resources/resource_04.json
Logs:
logs/run-11/stage3_unified_checker.log
logs/run-11/stage6_finisher.log
Disposition: Withheld from approval. Requires Semantic Fixer rerun on affected shards, then Finisher recheck.

6) Downstream Effects Validation (Scope Beyond “Correctness”)
These checks ensure we didn’t just “swap words,” but that the adapted simulation behaves correctly and feels realistic.
Downstream effects score (weighted)
Weighted compliance score (avg across runs): 98.6 / 100 ✅
Lowest run score: 97.9 (Run 11) ❌ (failed due to Critical leakage)
Top driver of flagged score drops: Persona realism (F1)
Examples of downstream validations performed
Learner-facing coherence across turns (no industry-jumping mid-flow)
Rubric language consistency with the new industry (e.g., “load factor”, “on-time performance”)
Resource plausibility for the scenario (memos/emails/tools match airline ops context)
Behavioral alignment (the system’s recommended options match scenario intent)

artifacts/run-*/rubric_alignment_eval.json

7) “Approved vs Not Approved” PR-Style Review
✅ Approved (Production-Ready)
Runs: 1–10, 12–20 (except flagged notes below)
Meets gate: ≥95% of runs pass all Critical checks
⚠️ Approved with Notes (Non-Blocking)
Runs: 3, 7, 9, 14, 16, 19
Notes: Persona realism tone drift; review recommended before client demo
❌ Not Approved (Blocked)
Run 11
Blocker: Entity leakage (C2)

8) Recommended Next Actions
Fix Run 11 leakage via targeted Semantic Fixer patch on the identified shards → rerun Finisher (dependency recheck only).
Improve Persona Realism (F1): update semantic templates/examples and add one additional flagged check for “role-appropriate tone.”
Add a client-facing “Confidence” banner: “Critical Gate Passed (95%), Flagged Issues Present (30%)” for transparency.
